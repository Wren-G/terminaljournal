Author and Programmer: Wren Gilbert

This README file is here both for documentation purposes, and for those who want to know more.
This program is meant to be a terminal journal, it currently only allows for one-line entries,
but hopefully that will change in time, or maybe even be the gimmick it uses!

All functions are commented for those who want to save time parsing through lines of code, and 
some even have in-line comments, usually as leftover from the brainstorming stage where I laid 
out my pseudocode.
